        <p>As long as these guys have been around, Modest Mouse has one of the most innovative sounds in the indie music industry.
          Isaac Brock is a lyrical genius that uses metaphors to highlight the raw subjects of life and death, relatable human conditions,
           religious experiences, and the deep meaning of existence. It creates a different depth in music that steadily entertains. Isaac's vocals have high and low pitches,
            from shouting to deep baritone to a southern drawl. Some listeners describe his voice as a "drunken twang." With Isaac's vocals
            and the band's multiple rhythms of stringed instruments, Modest Mouse creates a variety of slow and fast paced sounds within their tracklists.</p>
